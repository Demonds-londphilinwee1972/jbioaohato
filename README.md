Oh my goodness, where do I even start? Just walked out of Death of a Unicorn and my head is spinning like that time Gerald tried to fix the ceiling fan. The theater was a zoo, I swear someone behind me was eating popcorn loud enough to wake Granny from the grave—crumbs everywhere—just a mess, just like that scene... you know, the one where the protagonist just stood there, amongst the chaos. Does that even make sense? Probably not.

> The tension was thicker than my pre-dinner gravy, can you believe? James, or was it John?—he’s the guy who just kept staring into the horizon, like he was hoping his thoughts would materialize into a real unicorn or something. People say the sound was muffled, like when you talk to your kids through a closed door, but I think it added to the mystery. Like whispering secrets to a wall.

And the colors! So vivid, like Karen's new living room makeover, all yellows and blues smashed together, as if someone gave a toddler a paintbrush and a mission. There was this part, half way through, when it hit me: the symbolism was so on-the-nose, like when you smear peanut butter straight onto wonder bread. No point pretending there's depth there.

My back’s aching from these theater seats—honestly, who designs them? Torture chamber experts? Felt like I was trekking through the movie myself, dodging plot holes like they were tiny landmines. And that fight scene! Ridiculous yet somehow gripping, a bit like trying to untangle Christmas lights with oven mitts on.

> Someone told me I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie later or something, but it’s the kind of experience best kept on the big screen, where the unicorn dreams loom large, kinda like my laundry pile after a long week. Oh, and that one bit reminded me of when Emilio got into the flour jar—absolute chaos—flour everywhere, unexpected yet somehow magical.

Oh, Tessa, if you ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie, prepare for the ending—don’t know what the director was thinking, but he definitely stirred the pot and threw in bewilderment as the main ingredient. Anyway, not sure what I’m typing anymore, mind's wandering like it does when I have to guess what’s for dinner.

Random unrelated bit of code just here for no reason at all (no idea why this is relevant but feels oddly comforting):

```csharp
public void UnicornMagic()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < magicPotions.Count; i++)
    {
        TransformDreams(magicPotions[i]);
    }
}
```

Remember to bring tissues if you’re sentimental, or maybe just for the sticky popcorn residue—take your pick!
